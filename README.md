# Simple Restaurant voter for the Station Five Team WIP. Using GraphQL + React-beautiful-dnd + hooks!

WIP App can be found here 
[s5-food-voter](https://s5-lets-eat.firebaseapp.com/)

## To install please do the following
1) Clone the repo
2) Yarn install
3) Create .env file and add the following REACT_APP_S5_BASE_URL=https://s5-food.herokuapp.com/graphql (obviously shouldn't be sharing this, but not sensitive so that's ok)

## Need to do the following
1) Clean up the onDragFunction - got it going but need to refactor and use proper variable names
2) The use case when more than one user is using the app
3) Currently am mutating state, this is not ideal. Just wanted to get it working with GraphQL + React-beautiful-dnd

1) react-apollo 
2) apollo-client
3) apollo-link-http
